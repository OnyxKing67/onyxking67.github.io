<h1>20th July 2023 - OnyxKing67</h1>
<h2>Since 2020, we've been holding A annual event at the end of the year called Collabaganda, and it has been A success. This year, we wanted to add A mid-year Collabaganda but with A twist. This is Collabaganda Shorts, the same old Collabaganda but instead your submission must be A in the style of A YT Short/TikTok. How it works is simple, fans get to submit fan-made OnyxKing-themed videos but in the style of A YouTube short/TikTok & get it to appear on the channel.</h2>
<h2>The possibilities you can do is almost endless. You can re-animate A Gianni Matragrano or A Luke Correia short with the OnyxGang, or you favourite moment from you favourite game/show, or maybe something Original (e.g Your OC VS EM64).</h2>
