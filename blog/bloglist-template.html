<h1>14th October 2023 - Generalisk</h1>
<h2>Hello chat, Generalisk here!</h2>
<h2>Back in July of this year, I made the official OnyxKing website using my crappy HTML skills and GitHub. Fast forward to now, I'm STILL using GitHub but my HTML skills are not as crappy now. So now, I feel like it's time I gave the website A visual upgrade. I have went and remade the page template from the ground up & rewrote all the pages with this new template, while making adjustments to each and every page.</h2>
<h2>One the main major changes to the site is the addition of A search page. Which means I had to go and add A whole lot of new pages, otherwise the search results would be really small.</h2>
<h2>Speaking of new pages, we added new character pages & expanded out existing character pages. The goal here was to make those pages feel like A wiki.</h2>
<h2>Which reminds me, you may have noticed that the "About Us" page is gone, that is because we removed it as most of it's contents have been merged with the Home page.</h2>
<h2>I'm also very paranoid rn about forgetting something when remastering the the website so if you see something unfinished or a bug or a invalid link, please let me know.</h2>
<h2>and thats all, peace out.</h2>

<h1 style="font-size:48px;"><a target="_blank" href="post-00002.html">Zelus' theme, Evil Beneath the Surface, is NOW PUBLICLY AVAILABLE on YouTube</a></h1>
<h1>30th August 2023 - OnyxKing67</h1>
<h2>In 2020, we comissioned Callum Stamp, AKA Blocked Content, to make Zelus' theme. In which he made "Evil Beneath the Surface". This theme was used recurringly throughout the Revenge of Zelus arc until the end of the arc where she, of course, died. With her dead, there was no longer a reason for us to keep using her theme so we therefore stopped using it in our videos.</h2>
<h2>(Although I think we did post the song on patreon back in 2021-ish.)</h2>
<h2>Fast forward to 2023 and shes STILL DEAD (not big soup rice). But in May, we decided to create a new channel dedicated to the custom music we make for our videos. (I don't know why we didn't do this sooner)</h2>
<h2>So once we set the channel up, we immediately wanted to start posting songs onto the channel so the logical thing to do was to pick the oldest, that being this one.</h2>
<h2>We started setting it up back in June/July but due to Hugh's debut being right around the corner, we got too busy to finish setting it up. But now that Hugh has made it's debut, we now had the time to finish setting it up (mainly the album cover since that was the only thing that wasn't done at that point).</h2>
<h2>So here we are, now making Zelus' theme officially available to the public. You can now watch it on YouTube or here on the website.</h2>
<h2>We plan to upload more music in the future. (and maybe some covers?)</h2>
<h1><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/mx9FRggBD_g">Watch on YouTube</a></h1>
<h1><a target="_blank" href="https://onyxking67.github.io/albums/single-evilbeneaththesurface.html">Listen to on the website</a></h1>

<h1>20th July 2023 - OnyxKing67</h1>
<h2>Since 2020, we've been holding A annual event at the end of the year called Collabaganda, and it has been A success. This year, we wanted to add A mid-year Collabaganda but with A twist.

<h2>The possibilities you can do is almost endless. You can re-animate A Gianni Matragrano or A Luke Correia short with the OnyxGang, or you favourite moment from you favourite game/show, or maybe something Original (e.g Your OC VS EM64).</h2>
<h1>Rules</h1>
<h2>1. Must be between 2 - 15 Seconds Long</h2>
<h2>2. Must be an Animation.</h2>
<h2>3. Must contain at least one OnyxKing Character.</h2>
<h2>4. One Entry per Person</h2>
